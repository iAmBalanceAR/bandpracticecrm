Development Report - Band Practice Agent
Today's Work Summary
Primary focus: Navigation system improvements and bug fixes

Key Changes Made
Removed navigation hiding logic to ensure consistent visibility across all routes
Fixed path handling for root ('/') path to properly show dashboard
Simplified side menu component by removing unnecessary path checking logic
Maintained existing functionality while removing potential sources of navigation flicker
Technical Details
Key component modifications:

Removed shouldHideNavigation logic from SideMenu component
Removed usePathname hook as it's no longer needed
Maintained responsive design with sidebarOpen state
Preserved all navigation links and their respective icons
Current State Analysis
Working Features
Side navigation consistently visible across all routes
Collapsible sidebar functionality
Proper routing through Next.js Link components
Responsive design for both expanded and collapsed states
Pending Issues
Metadata warnings in Next.js console for viewport and themeColor configurations
Authentication state management needs review (getSession vs getUser)
Calendar route typo: "calender" should be "calendar"
Project Analysis
The Band Practice Agent project shows strong potential with its comprehensive feature set. The current implementation follows modern web development practices with Next.js and maintains good separation of concerns.

Architectural Observations
Clean component structure with clear responsibility separation
Consistent use of Tailwind CSS for styling
Proper implementation of client-side navigation
Good use of TypeScript for type safety
Next Steps
Immediate Priorities
Fix calendar route spelling ("calender" → "calendar")
Address metadata configuration warnings
Update authentication to use getUser instead of getSession
Short-term Improvements
Add active state styling for current route in navigation
Implement proper error boundaries for route handling
Add loading states for route transitions
Long-term Considerations
Consider implementing route-based code splitting
Add end-to-end testing for critical user paths
Implement performance monitoring
Technical Debt
Authentication system needs updating to latest Supabase best practices
Metadata configuration needs to be updated to Next.js 14 standards
Some components could benefit from proper error boundaries
