Another error i'm seeeing is pasted below.  But, before we touch any code, we need to talk about how parts o the site use/recieve user auth for data access.  I've started this process severl times and always end up reverting back to the current codebase when the site blows up and becomes  unrecoverable.  So do this for me first.  Look at @leads and @calender and compairte the methods being used to authenticate the user.  Then report back and we'll talk about a course of action.  Again ,do not udate any code at this point.. This is discovery and speculative only.

Using the user object as returned from supabase.auth.getSession() or from some supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange() events could be insecure! This value comes directly from the storage medium (usually cookies on the server) and may not be authentic. Use supabase.auth.getUser() instead which authenticates the data by contacting the Supabase Auth server.

I'll analyze how authentication is handled in both the leads and calendar sections.
Let me check the components that might be handling the authentication in these sections.
After analyzing both sections, here's what I found regarding authentication methods:
Leads Section:
Uses client-side Supabase client (createClient() from '@/utils/supabase/client')
Relies on RPC calls (get_leads) for data fetching
No explicit user authentication check before data fetching
Uses realtime subscriptions for updates
Calendar/Gigs Section:
Also uses client-side Supabase client
Uses the useAuth hook from auth-provider which provides:
isAuthenticated state
loading state
Explicitly checks authentication status before operations
Also uses realtime subscriptions
The warning you're seeing is important because:
The current implementation might be using getSession() in some places, which gets data from storage (cookies) without verifying with the Supabase server
Some components are accessing data without explicitly checking authentication status
There's inconsistency between how the different sections handle authentication
Key Issues to Address:
Inconsistent authentication checking across components
Potential security vulnerabilities from using unverified session data
No standardized approach to handling authentication states
Missing proper error boundaries for unauthenticated states
Would you like to discuss a strategy for standardizing the authentication approach across these sections? I can propose a plan that would:
Standardize authentication using getUser()
Implement consistent auth checking
Handle authentication states uniformly
Protect routes and data access consistently
Let me know if you'd like to proceed with planning this standardization, and we can work on it step by step to avoid breaking the application.
between those two secteions, which method is the perfered wqy?

Looking at the two approaches:
Calendar/Gigs Section's Method is the preferred approach because:
Uses the useAuth hook which provides a centralized, consistent way to handle authentication
Explicitly checks isAuthenticated state before operations
Includes a loading state for better UX
Follows React's best practices with hooks and context
More secure as it's using a proper authentication check
Leads Section's Method is less ideal because:
No explicit authentication checks
Relies solely on RPC calls without verifying auth state
Could potentially expose data if the session is invalid
Lacks proper loading state management
More prone to security issues
The Calendar/Gigs section's approach using useAuth hook is definitely the better pattern because:
It's more secure
It's more maintainable
It provides better state management
It follows React's component patterns better
It's easier to extend and modify
Would you like to discuss how to standardize all sections to use the Calendar/Gigs approach with the useAuth hook?
okay, if we were to :"fix" the error i sent, would one or both sections suffer auth problems as a result?

Let me analyze the error message again:
Looking at both sections:
Calendar/Gigs Section:
Uses useAuth hook which likely already implements proper authentication checks
Would NOT be negatively affected by switching to getUser()
Already follows a secure pattern
Leads Section:
Currently lacks explicit auth checks
Relies on direct RPC calls
WOULD be affected if we just changed getSession() to getUser() without proper implementation
Could potentially break if we don't handle the auth state properly
So yes, the Leads section would likely have auth problems if we just "fixed" the error without properly implementing the authentication pattern. The better approach would be to:
First standardize both sections to use the useAuth hook pattern (like the Calendar section)
Then implement the getUser() change
Would you like to see a step-by-step plan for safely making these changes without breaking either section?
