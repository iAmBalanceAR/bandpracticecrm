STRIPE CUSTOMER ID ISSUE - February 1, 2024

ISSUE:
- Error encountered: "No such customer: '8d7a73c6-b048-44e5-a298-717676d538bf'"
- The system was using Supabase user UUID instead of actual Stripe customer ID
- This occurred when trying to cancel subscriptions or access billing portal

INVESTIGATION:
1. Found that stripe_customer_id in profiles table contained Supabase UUID instead of Stripe cus_* ID
2. Traced data flow:
   - Stripe checkout success page correctly receives customer ID
   - Webhook handler properly receives Stripe customer ID
   - Issue identified in profile creation/update logic

ATTEMPTED FIXES:
1. Updated webhook handler to store correct Stripe customer ID:
   ```typescript
   .update({
     subscription_status: subscription.status,
     subscription_id: subscription.id,
     subscription_price_id: subscription.items.data[0]?.price.id || null,
     stripe_customer_id: subscription.customer as string  // Added this line
   })
   ```

2. Added sync endpoints:
   - /api/sync-subscriptions (POST) - Syncs all users
   - /api/sync-subscription (GET) - Syncs single user

NEXT STEPS:
1. Verify stripe_customer_id in profiles table starts with 'cus_'
2. Run sync to update existing profiles with correct Stripe customer IDs
3. Monitor webhook handler to ensure it continues storing correct IDs
